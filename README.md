HTML and CSS Code Refactor

Description

This is a basic project in which I have taken existing code and re-written with semantic HTML elements to better meet standards for acccessibility and search engine optimiation. I also added many classes to similarly-styled elements to shorten the CSS file by removing redundant code.
